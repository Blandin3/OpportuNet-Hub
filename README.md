## Setup & Installation

### 1. Backend

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL server

#### Install dependencies
```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in `Backend/` with:
```
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=hr_management_system
DB_PORT=3306
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_for_ai
PUTER_API_KEY=your_puter_api_key
```

#### Run the server
```bash
python server.py
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/api/`

### 2. Frontend

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or bun

#### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

#### Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### 3. Database

- Import the schema from `Backend/hr_management_system.sql` into your MySQL server:
```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < hr_management_system.sql
```
- Update your `.env` to match your DB credentials.

---

## Environment Variables
- **Backend**: See above for required variables in `.env`.
- **Frontend**: If you use environment variables, add them to `.env` in the root (see Vite docs).

---

## Usage

- **HR Admins**:
  - Login/signup as HR
  - Create/manage job positions
  - View, filter, and rank candidates
  - Use AI-powered sorting and download reports
  - Manage application statuses and send emails

- **Candidates**:
  - Signup/login as candidate
  - Complete profile, upload CV, apply for jobs
  - Track application status and download application history

---

## AI Scoring & Ranking
- **Backend**: When a candidate applies, the backend calls an AI model (DeepSeek/PUTER) with job and candidate data. The AI returns a fit score (0-100) and explanation, which is stored in the database.
- **Frontend**: Custom algorithms (see `src/lib/aiRanking.ts` and `src/lib/scoring.ts`) allow HR to re-rank candidates by experience, skills, education, and location, with adjustable weights.
- **Manual & AI Scores**: Both manual and AI scores are supported and visible in the admin dashboard.
